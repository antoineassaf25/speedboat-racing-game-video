# speedboat-racing-game-video

This repository has no code! I have been working on a Speedboat Racing game on Roblox, and to protect my product I've decided not to put the code here. However, [HERE](https://youtu.be/dW4Jqd0X_Qk) is a video link to some of my developer insights on how I went about the physics and AI CPUs. You can find the game [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/17515784677/Speedboat-Racing-WIP), but you will only have access if you have a free Roblox account and are part of my group (feel free to join), unless the game is already released. 

This project is coded in Lua, powered by the Roblox Studio game engine. All assets (besides the music) are created by me. Thanks!
